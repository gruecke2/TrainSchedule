# TrainSchedule
## A firebase project to calculate different train schedules.
    Train information is pulled from a firebase database, times and mins away are calculated from that information.
    Users can also enter in a train of their own which will be added to the database and uploaded. User input validation
    is mostly handled through the use of HTML5 input options.
